## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it by emailing:

**rob@superiortech.io**

- Suggested fix (if any)

You will receive a response within 48 hours acknowledging receipt. Security issues will be prioritized and addressed as quickly as possible.

## Security Considerations

This MCP server:
- Runs locally on your machine
- Uses the `numbers-parser` Python library to read/write `.numbers` files, and AppleScript to drive Numbers.app for formatting and formulas
- Saves file modifications atomically (temp file + `os.replace`) so an interrupted write cannot corrupt the target file
- Does not transmit data to external servers
- Does not store credentials or passwords

The formatting/formula tools require macOS automation permission for Numbers.app. These permissions are managed by macOS and can be revoked at any time in System Settings → Privacy & Security → Automation.
